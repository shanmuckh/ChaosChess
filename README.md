# ChaosChess

A simple chess game built in Godot where everything starts normal... until turn 5.

After the 5th turn, random **chaos events** start triggering with a 50% chance at the end of each round. These events mess with the game in unpredictable ways, swapping pieces, messing up the board, and generally ruining any serious strategy.

## How It Works

- Standard chess rules
- Chaos begins **after round 5** (i.e. after both sides have moved 5 times).
- Every round after that has a **50% chance** to trigger a chaos event.
- Game ends when a king is captured (yes that's possible here) or no legal moves remain.
- Play against yourself or CPU.

## Stuff To Do (Maybe)

- Better AI 
- More chaos event variety
- Configurable chaos frequency
- ~Sounds and effects~ DONE âœ…
